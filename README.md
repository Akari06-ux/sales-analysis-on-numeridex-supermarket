## Introduction
This project analyzes a supermarket sales dataset containing detailed information on customer transactions across multiple branches. The aim is to identify sales trends, understand customer purchasing behavior, and evaluate overall business performance. Using Power BI, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized through interactive dashboards. These dashboards highlight sales trends across branches, top-performing product lines, customer preferences, and payment patterns. The insights gained from this analysis provide a clear understanding of what drives revenue and customer satisfaction, supporting data-driven decision-making for future growth.

## Objectives
The objectives of this project are:
1.  To analyze overall sales performance across different product categories, cities, and branches to identify key revenue drivers.
2.  To evaluate customer distribution and purchasing behavior based on customer type, gender, and payment method.
3.  To monitor monthly sales trends in order to identify peak and low-performing periods.
4.  To assess product category performance by comparing total sales and average unit prices across cities.
5.  To measure customer engagement and satisfaction levels through the average rating metric.
6.  To understand branch-level performance and how customer type influences sales within each branch.
7.  To identify actionable insights that can guide business strategies, improve sales efficiency, and enhance customer experience.

## Insights and Interpretation
* The store generated sales of over ₦36,630 from 582 units sold, maintaining a consistent 5% tax rate.
* Health & Beauty (≈₦8.3k), Sports & Travel (≈₦7.4k), and Food & Beverages (≈₦6.9k) are the top-performing product categories, driving the majority of sales revenue.
* Branch C (Naypyitaw) achieved the highest overall sales at ₦13,967.37, despite having the same transaction volume as other branches (A), indicating higher revenue per transaction, followed by Branch A (Yangon) at ₦12,287.64 and Branch B (Mandalay) with the lowest performance.
* E-wallet emerged as the dominant payment method with over ₦15,540 in revenue, substantially outperforming both cash (₦12,990) and credit card (₦8,090) payments, reflecting strong customer preference for digital transactions.
* Normal customers (₦19,760 ) generate more total revenue than Members(₦16,870). Though Member behavior indicates higher value, with increased spend and stronger loyalty—most evident in Branch B, where member transactions outpaced non-member sales.
* Sales performance peaked in March (≈₦13.5K) after a February dip (≈₦11.1K).
* The average customer rating of 6.89 indicates moderate satisfaction, highlighting opportunities for service quality improvements.

## Recommendations

* Increase stock and promotional activities for Health & Beauty, Sports & Travel, and Food & Beverages to capitalize on high demand.
* Investigate and address underperformance in Electronic Accessories, Fashion Accessories, and Home & Lifestyle through pricing reviews or product repositioning.
* Study and replicate Branch C's successful strategies across Branch A and Branch B to improve overall sales performance.
* Strengthen membership programs with exclusive benefits and discounts to convert more normal customers into loyal members.
* Introduce E-wallet payment incentives such as cashback or loyalty points to encourage digital adoption and reduce transaction costs.
* Improve customer experience and service quality to raise the average rating above 6.89, particularly in lower-rated branches.
* Implement strategic bundling of underperforming products with top sellers to boost sales of weaker categories.

## Conclusion
This analysis has successfully identified the key drivers of sales performance across product categories, cities, and branches, while providing valuable insights into customer purchasing behavior and payment preferences. Monthly trend analysis revealed seasonal patterns in sales activity, and cross-city comparisons highlighted regional variations in product demand and pricing. Customer satisfaction ratings indicated areas requiring service improvement, while customer type emerged as a significant factor influencing branch performance. These findings provide management with a data-driven foundation to make informed strategic decisions, optimize operational efficiency, enhance customer loyalty, and improve overall business performance.
